# CWin32
Lets make win32 looks good with class.

First I'm sorry for my bad english, but, it's only used to explain same functions and... others stuffs...
So, don't worry if you don't understand something. Later, I'll create a documentation with a decent english...
(Honestly, even I don't understand the comments that I make).
